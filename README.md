# MMAT
Modelling Method Advisory Tool (MMAT) is a web-based pipeline which can greatly enhance the modelling experience of an individual. It is an easy to use, one click program that lets the user input a protein sequence and in turn suggests what modelling method would be favourable in the current situation. The task of comparing sequences and finding the desired modelling method can be eliminated by the use of MMAT. The time it usually takes for a protein to be compared and inputted to a desired modelling method API is pretty huge when seen from the point of view of an individual of a fast paced generation. MMAT has been created in such a way that the sequence you provide is analysed and the result not only suggests you the modelling method, it even given you certain approximate properties of the given protein sequence.
